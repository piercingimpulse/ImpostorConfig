# ImpostorConfig (LAN)
 ImpostorConfig is an iOS tweak that makes it easy to use custom Among Us servers.
 This is a fork made specifically for iOS 8.x - it allows the player to join a game hosted in LAN.
 
## How to use the Tweak
### Server/Host
 You don't need the tweak if you ONLY hosting, but you have to forward port on your router TCP/UDP to 22023.
 Give your public IP to your guests.

### Guests
 Just activate the tweak from the Setting and input the public IP of the Host.
 Launch Among Us, go to Local and click on "Create Game" and it will connect to the host.
 
 ## TO DO
 [] Create broadcast message and option (eg: broadcast timer);
 [] More option for Host (ex: custom port forward);
 [x] Ensure client can be host with tweak.
